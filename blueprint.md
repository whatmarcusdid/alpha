# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for creating a "My Speed and Safety" page in the dashboard. This page will display the results of a Lighthouse audit, providing users with a clear understanding of their website's performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO.

## Plan

1.  **Create the directory:** Create the `app/dashboard/my-speed-and-safety` directory.
2.  **Create `page.tsx`:** Create the `app/dashboard/my-speed-and-safety/page.tsx` file. This file will contain the main component for the page, which will display the Lighthouse scores in a visually appealing and easy-to-understand format.
3.  **Create `layout.tsx`:** Create the `app/dashboard/my-speed-and-safety/layout.tsx` file to provide a consistent layout for this section of the dashboard.
4.  **Create `loading.tsx`:** Create the `app/dashboard/my-speed-and-safety/loading.tsx` file to display a loading indicator while the Lighthouse data is being fetched.
5.  **Create `error.tsx`:** Create the `app/dashboard/my-speed-and-safety/error.tsx` file to handle any errors that may occur while fetching the Lighthouse data.
